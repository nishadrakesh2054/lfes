                    We follow the Nepal Government curriculum and ensure
                    progressive teaching skills that are practiced in an
                    international context. Planned activities within the
                    curriculum enable students to identify their strengths,
                    skills, and ambitions so they may make suitable choices that
                    are best suited for them. Our teaching-learning is based on
                    a student-centric approach; therefore, the acquisition of
                    new knowledge is made more meaningful through the prospect
                    of applying it. <br />
                    We would like to extend a warm welcome to the Middle School
                    of LFES. Students in middle school are in a transition
                    stage, where a more extraordinary ability for conceptual
                    thinking emerges in children. It focuses on developing
                    independent learners who are prepared to succeed in high
                    school and beyond. The shift from a theme-based approach to
                    a more specialized and focused understanding of concepts
                    helps students gain more interest in different subjects.{" "}
                    <br />
                    Little Flowers‚Äô English School aims to draw the best
                    elements of the curriculum, combined with the depth and
                    range of subjects that are based on age-appropriate learning
                    goals. Good education not only develops character and a
                    sense of value but also maintains a balance between the
                    academic and ECA areas. With this in mind, we aim to provide
                    a wide range of extracurricular activities to meet the needs
                    of all students for their holistic development. Projects,
                    exhibitions, presentations, or field trips ensure that
                    learners find opportunities to see theory in practice.
                    <br />
                    Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning.
                    Assessment can mainly be formative and summative. It starts
                    with a formative assessment of each subject, and it is
                    carried out throughout the year as a continuous assessment.
                    This test is based on their skills and understanding. The
                    other assessments and evaluations are based on summative
                    assessment. This is reflected at the end of each term on the
                    evaluation grade sheet.
